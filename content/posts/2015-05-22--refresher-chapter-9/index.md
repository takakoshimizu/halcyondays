In lesson 9, we learn the past tense form of short-forms/casual/whatever verbs, as well as past tense of adjectives and nouns in short form/casual/whatever.

You get the idea.

Additionally, we will learn how to qualify a noun with a verb or adjective clause, the present perfect, and more ways to explain.

##### Past Tense Casual

###### Verbs
To make the past tense of a casual verb in the affirmative, simply replace the `て` or `で` in `て-form` with a `た` or `だ` respectively. In other words, the conjugation is the same, but the ending syllable is in the `あ` row.

> `読む` -> `よんで` -> `よんだ`

> `歩く` -> `歩いて` -> `歩いた`

For the negative, take the present tense `ない` ending, and convert to `なかった`, similar to a negative adjective in the past.

> `読む` -> `読まない` -> `読まなかった`

> `歩く` -> `歩かない` -> `歩かなかった`

###### Adjectives

For `い-adjectives`, it's the same as before, but without the `です`.

> `かわいい` -> `かわいかった` -> `かわくなかった`

###### Nouns

For nouns and `な-adjectives`, you will use `だった` in place of `だ` for the positive, and `じゃなかった` in place of `じゃない` for the negative.

> `静かだ` -> `静かだった` -> `静かじゃなかった`

> `先生だ` -> `先生だった` -> `先生じゃなかった`

You may notice a pattern. Indeed, `った` tends to be used for the past.

They're used in the same situations as regular short forms, but in the past!

##### Qualifying Nouns

Think in English for a moment, about when you need to describe an specific object or person. You may use an adjective, which you can already do. Or you may describe them with what they're *doing*, which is what this is all about.

> The girl running over there is Lili.

How would we express this in Japanese? Easily with short forms. You can construct an entire other sentence, used as a clause, to describe a single noun.

> run over there

> `あそこで走る`

> the girl

> `女の子`

> is Lili

> `はリリだ`

Let's put it all together.

> `あそこで走る女の子はリリだ` -> The running over there girl is Lili.

As you can see, the clause prior to the noun could be a sentence on it's own, and it is placed immediately before the noun to further describe the noun.

Combined with adjectives, you can describe almost anything now.

##### Present Perfect

To describe present perfect tense in Japanese, for the affirmative, you simply use the past tense. The perfect part is contained in a separate word!

> `もう晩ご飯を食べた` -> I've already eaten dinner.

> Tense contained in the `もう` -> already, as it's connected with the present.

For the negative, you'd use a construct `まだ...ていない`, to imply 'not yet' and 'still ongoing'. That is, a negative `て-form.`

> `まだ晩ご飯を食べていない` -> I haven't eaten dinner.

##### Explanations

We've already learned explaining a previous sentence by adding another sentence ending in `から`. But you can also prepend the situational sentence with the explanation.

> [explanation]`から`[situation].

> `お金を持つから、ゲームを買ましょう`

> I have money, so let's buy a game.

(note: I am still not personally clear on when to use `がある` to indicate having something, and when to use `を持つ` to indicate you have it by saying you're 'holding it')
