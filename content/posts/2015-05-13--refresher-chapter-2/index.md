Continuing on the refresher course, we'll now be working on Lesson 2! Lesson 2 began digging into more grammar points in a single go.

##### これ, それ, あれ, and どれ

The above words are used to refer to objects we are referring to indirectly, or do not know the name of. `これ` means `this`, referring to an object near you, the speaker. `それ` means `that`,  referring to an object near the person being spoken to. `あれ` means `that over there`, referring to an object near neither the speaker nor listener.

`どれ` is in the same class, but means `which`. It is a question word for objects. Question words cannot be followed by `は`, and instead must be used with the particle `が`.

##### この, その, あの, and どの

The words are the same as the four described in the previous section, except they are attached to nouns to describe the idea of `this (noun)`.

> To ask how much a watch you're holding costs, you can say `これはいくらですか` using the first set of words, or be more specific and ask `この 腕時計[うでどけい] はいくらですか` to specifically mention the watch.

##### だれ

Another question word is `だれ` which means `who`. One can use this word the particle `の` to turn it into `whose`. For example, to ask whose bag this is, one would say `これ、だれのかばんですか`.

##### ここ, そこ, あそこ, どこ

Another set of location words is this set. Similar to above, each involves proximity to the speaker and listener, meaning `here`, `there`, `over there`, and `where`, respectively.

##### も

The particle `も` is used to indicate that two nouns have a shared property. `も` replaces `は` in a sentence. It also only makes sense if you're coming after another statement.

> After your friend says that her mother is American, you could respond with `母もアメリカ人です` that your mother is *also* American. This could be simplified further to `母も` as the remainder of the sentence is context.

##### じゃありません

To negate a present-tense noun or na-adjective sentence, one would replace `です` with `じゃありません`. This is the negative form of the sentence-final coppola, and will negate the sentence coming before it (keep in mind, i-adjective conjugation and casual speech comes later).

> To turn the sentence `I'm Fred` into `I'm not Fred`, one would simply turn `フレッドです` into `フレッドじゃありません` by replacing the sentence-final.

##### ね and よ

The above are two additional sentence-finals that would go on the end after a `です` or `じゃありません`.

`ね` carries a connotation of `right?` or `isn't it?`

> `いいお天気ですね。。。` > Nice weather, huh?

`よ` shows assertion on the truth of what's been said. It could translate to `I'm telling you,` or `let me assure you` or the like.

> `メアリーさんを殺さなかったよ！` > I'm telling you, I didn't kill Mary!
