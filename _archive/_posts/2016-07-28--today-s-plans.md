Today, I intend to get started again. I will re-read *all* of the grammar sections and expression notes for *all* of Genki I. I will make a list of things that I do not remember clearly, and re-study their work sections.

I will also clear out my lessons (of which I currently have 14) in Wanikani.

It's time I get going again.
