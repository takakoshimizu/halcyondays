So, again we are given a way to add a 'because' to a sentence.

This time, the ending is `ので`, which can be used just like `から`. However, `ので` sounds more formal.

In this case, the `ので` is appended to the short-form predicate. When coming after an `な-adjective` or noun, `な` comes in between, similar to `んです`.

> `お金があまり持っているので、ランドムさんはフィギュアが買わなかった。` Random did not buy a figure, because he didn't have much money.

> `その彼女は超静かなので、友達が少ない。` Since she's super quiet, she doesn't have many friends.
