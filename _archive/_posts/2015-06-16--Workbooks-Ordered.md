Up until now, I had been doing workbook exercises out of a printed PDF.  That's a bit expensive, so I have ordered the books properly. I haven't done workbook since lesson 8 or so,so I'll go back and do those rapidly. At this point it should be quick.

After that I'll move forward. I'm already mulling over lesson 13 grammar in my Head.
