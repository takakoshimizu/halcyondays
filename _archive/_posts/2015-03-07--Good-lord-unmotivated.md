So, I have a problem.

Right now, I haven't been learning grammar in weeks.

I have been maintaining and advancing at Wanikani, for vocabulary, but I'm still complete shit at grammar.

I NEED to get back to grammar. I NEED to continue Genki.

I've been in the process of buying a house, but that's no mistake. I need to get back to it, ASAP.
