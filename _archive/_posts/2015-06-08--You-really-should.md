In this exercise, we are given cues to give to a friend with a headache as `ほうがいい` suggestions. The important thing here is to decide from the Japanese cues whether to use the affirmative or negative forms.

As stated in the grammar section, positive suggestions use the past tense short form, and negative suggestions use the present tense negative short form.

- `早く寝たほうがいいですよ。`
 - You'd better go bed early.
- `遊びに行かないほうがいいですよ。`
 - You shouldn't go play.
- `病院に行ったほうがいいですよ。`
 - It'd be best if you went to the hospital.
- `仕事を休んだほうがいいですよ。`
 - It'd be best if you took time off work.
- `家に帰ったほうがいいですよ。`
 - You'd best go home.
- `運動しないほうがいいですよ。`
 - You'd better not exercise.
