It's been just so, so long. I'm sure you know how that goes, and you know what that means...

In other words, I have to refresh my memory. On everything.

Today, I will be (besides paying taxes...) re-reading the grammar definitions for every chapter of Genki up through 13. Chances are, that's a bit much for one day, so I'll be doing this Monday as well.

I'll update with the information for how much I get done. It's going to be a long road to getting going all over again.

EDIT: I managed to go back over the first 3 lessons. No problems there!
