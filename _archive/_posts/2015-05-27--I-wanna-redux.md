Technically, this exercise was completed before I fell off the train, but because it's been so long, I'm going to do it again!

We are presented with short verb phrases, and are given a `はい` or `いいえ` prompt, and must turn the phrase into a sentence with whether we want to or not, that phrase.

 - `湖に行きたいです。`
  - I want to go to the lake.
 - `日本語のテープが聞きたいです。`
  - I want to listen to a Japanese tape.
 - `旅行がしたいです。`
  - I want to go on a trip.
 - `ゆっくり休みたくないです。`
  - I don't want to take a relaxing break.
 - `会社の社長になりたくないです。`
  - I don't want to become a company president.
 - `日本で働きたいです。`
  - I want to work in Japan.
 - `車が買いたいです。`.
  - I want to buy a car.
 - `留学したいです。`
  - I want to study abroad.
 - `山に登りたくないです。`
  - I don't want to climb a mountain.
