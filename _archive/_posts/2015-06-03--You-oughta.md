One can express the idea that "It's best if you did..." by using the sentence-final expression `ほうがいいです` following a short form verb.

When using this expression, you are giving advice to the listener, that they should follow this advice or there'll be a problem or danger if not followed.

`ほうがいいです` is also weird, because it uses a different tense depending on whether the advice is positive or negative. If the advice is positive, then the tense is in the past.

> `もっと野菜を食べたほうがいいです` You'd better eat more vegetables.

If the advice is negative, then the tense is present tense.

> `授業を休まないほうがいいですよ` You should not skip classes.
