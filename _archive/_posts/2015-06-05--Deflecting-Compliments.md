This time, we are going to be given a comment from another person, about an item, in Japanese. We are provided with an English explanation for that comment that we should give.

Most of these are of course, deflecting compliments away from yourself, in typical Japanese style.

- `友達からもらったんです。`
 - I got them from my friend.
- `イタリアのなんです。`
 - They're Italian!
- `母が作ったんです。`
 - My mother made it.
- `安かったんです。`
 - It was cheap.
- `優しいんです。`
 - He's kind.
