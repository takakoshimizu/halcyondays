You can use `～なくちゃいけません` to say that it's necessary to do something, or that you 'must'.

> `来週テストがあるから、たくさん勉強しなくちゃいけません` I have to study a lot, because there's a test next week.

`なくちゃ` is a verb ending meaning `if you do not...` and `いけません` means `you cannot go`, so together, the double negative turns it into an implication that `you cannot go ahead (in life) without doing X`.

To form this ending, simply begin the negative short form of the verb, and replace the `い` with `くちゃ`.

> `食べなくちゃいけない` You must eat.

> `言わなくちゃいけない` You must speak.

> `しなくちゃいけない` You must do.

> `来なくちゃいけない` You must come.

To change tense on this construct, you will conjugate the `いけない`

> `飲まなくちゃいけませんでした` I had to drink.

> `泳がなくちゃいけなかった` I had to swim.

Additionally, you would use the short form in casual speech and with elements like `んです`.
