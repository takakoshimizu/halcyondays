Skipping ahead a bit, due to multiple Pair Work exercises, in this exercise we will complete a sentence by inserting the proper verb into a blank. I guess this is an exercise in recalling the proper word.

- `今日はいい天気だから、泳ぎたいです。`
 - It's nice weather today, so I want to swim.
- `明日は休みだから朝寝坊したいです。`
 - Tomorrow's a day off, so I want to sleep in.
- `疲れたから、テニスをしたくないです。`
 - I don't want to play tennis because I'm tired.
- `田中さんは意地悪だから、一緒に映画を見たくなかったです。`
 - Tanaka-san is mean, so I don't want to watch a movie together with him.
- `高校の時、もっと日本語を勉強したかったです。`
 - When I was in high school, I wanted to study more Japanese.
