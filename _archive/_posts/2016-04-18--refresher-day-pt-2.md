Here we are again, and it's time to review more of Genki in order to get back on the train.

Today, I'm reviewing lessons 4-6. Again, no problems there. The hard parts start happening closer to 8+, when casual language is introduced.

I will get going again. I have to. There's too much work put into this to just give up.
