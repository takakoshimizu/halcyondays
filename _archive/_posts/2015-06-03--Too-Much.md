You can express the idea of doing something too much by appending a verb stem with `すぎる`.

> `食べ過ぎる` to eat too much

`すぎる` conjugates as a regular `る-verb`. It is actually just the verb `過ぎる` meaning `to exceed; to surpass`, but is usually written with kana only when used as a suffix.

`すぎる` can also follow adjectives. Simply remove either the `い` or `な` and append `すぎる`.

> `高すぎる` too high; too expensive
