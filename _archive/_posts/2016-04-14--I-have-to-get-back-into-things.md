Seriously, things are getting ridiculous. I've fallen so far off the train that I don't even know how to get back on.

Right now, it's been months since I've studied at all. It's just not even a part of my daily routine, or thought process anymore. How to get that back in line is just extremely difficult.

So here's what I'm going to do:

 - I'm going to be studying Genki during lunch at work instead of playing Halo 5 or Paragon.
 - I'm going to be writing on this with each study session.
 - I'm going to pick back on on Anki vocab review.

Once that's going in place, I will:
 - Pick back up on Wanikani.
 - Write on Lang-8 again.
 - Read NHK Easy News articles.
 - Read Yotsubato.

I can do this. I **have** to do this.
