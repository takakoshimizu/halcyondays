Beginning here in Lesson 6, we learn one of the most important constructs for the language--the `て-form`, a form of verbs that many parts of the language are built around.

##### て-form

The `て-form` is used for many, many things. Among others, making requests, giving and asking for permission, showing an ongoing action, describing a sequence of events, and more.

Conjugation of the `て-form` is somewhat complex (and is the same as casual form).

###### る-verbs

Easiest is conjugating `る-verbs`. You simply remove the final `る` and replace it with a `て`.

> `食べる` -> `食べて` -> `to eat`

###### う-verbs

Much more difficult. Each possible verb ending has a different conjugation to the `て-form`. To make it more confusing, some of these don't even end with `て`!

For verbs that end in `う`, `つ`, or `る`, you remove the last kana and replace with `って`.

> `待つ` -> `待って` -> `to wait`

For verbs ending in `む`, `ぶ`, or `ぬ`, you remove the last kana and replace with `んで`. Like I said, weird.

> `遊ぶ` -> `遊んで` -> `to play`

For verbs ending in `く`, you remove the final kana and replace with `いて`. If the final is `ぐ`, then the dakuten gets carried over into `いで`.

> `抜く` -> `抜いて` -> `to extract`

> `脱ぐ` -> `脱いで` -> `to undress`

There is an exception here, in `行く` which becomes `行って`.

Finally, verbs ending in `す` , you replace the final kana with `して`.

> `話す` -> `話して` -> `to speak`

Overwhelming, yes.

###### Irregular Verbs

The verbs `する` and `くる` are conjugated in a special way. `する` becomes `して` and `くる` becomes `きて`.

##### Requests

Using a `て-form` together with `ください` to make a polite request : `please do x`.

> `来てください` -> `please come here`

##### Permission

The `て-form` is also used to ask for permission and denials. Simply append `もいいです` to indicate permission (and a `か` to ask for it), and `はいけません` to indicate a lack of permission. Please note, the `は` is the particle.

##### Describing a Sequence

The `て-form` can also be used to describe two or more verbs in sequence of actions. That is to describe a sentence like `i did this then that`.

> `テレビを見ていて、寝ました` -> `I watched TV then went to bed.`

> (oooh, went double deep there)

Also can be used to link a verb loosely to the sentence, such as describing how another verb was done.

##### Because

`から` ending a sentence explains the reason for the previous sentence.

> `家に残りましょう。映画がやばいから。` -> `Let's stay home. Movies suck anyway.`

##### ましょう 改

While the last lesson taught us that we can use `...ましょうか` to mean `let's...`, it can also be used to offer assistance.
