Moving on to Lesson 4, where we learn some more verbs, past tense, and other exciting things.

##### いる / ある

`いる` and `ある` are special verbs that indicate existence, for living and nonliving things respectively.

###### ある

The verb `ある` indicates the existence of nonliving things. It is different from a regular verb in that it calls for `に` to mark the location. It also generally is attached to a subject marked by `が`.

You can also use `ある` to indicate that you have or own something, or to indicate that an event will take place.

> When used to indicate an event will take place, the particle `で` is used for the location as with normal verbs.

###### いる

The verb `いる` indicates the existence of a living thing. It is used in the same way as `ある` but only for an object such as a person or a cat, or another living thing.

> Please note that `いる` and `ある` are for descriptions of existence and location. `です` is for description of attributes of a person or thing.

##### Describing Locations

One can use several location words to describe where something is in relation to another object. These words are used as `no adjectives` of the object.

Useful location words, among others, are...

 - `右[みぎ]` to the right of
 - `左[ひだり]` to the left of
 - `前[まえ]` in front of
 - `後ろ[うしろ]` behind
 - `中[なか]` inside
 - `上[うえ]` on/above
 - `下[した]` under/beneath
 - `そば` near
 - `となり` next to
 - `近く[ちかく]` near

> To say the library is next to the post office, one would say `図書館[としょかん]は郵便局[ゆうびんきょく]のとなりです`

##### Past Tense

The past tense of formal verbs ends with `ました` in the affirmative, and `ませんでした` in the negative. For noun sentences, the endings are `でした` and `じゃありませんでした`.

##### Quantity Adverbs

When adding a quantity adverb to the direct object of a sentence, you can place it either before the noun, or after the particle `を`.

> Either `a lot of vegetables eaten` and `vegetables a lot eaten` mean the same thing.

##### Intervals

The duration of an activity is expressed with a bare noun without a particle and generally immediately before the verb. For an approximate measurement, you can add `ぐらい` or `ごろ`.

> `メアリーさんはそこでたけしさんを一時間待ちました.` Mary waited there for Takeshi for an hour.

##### と

Two functions of the `と` particle are to act as an `and` for connecting two nouns together, and to indicate doing something `together with...` someone.

When used as a connector, `と` presents an exhaustive list, as though the items presented are the only ones that fit that criteria.

Used the second way, it is placed after a noun to indicate that the verb took place along with that noun.

> `妻と映画を見ました` I saw a movie with my wife.

##### も

As with describing a common attribute between two nouns, one can also use `も` to describe a common action.

In any case, `も` replaces the particles `は`, `が`, and `を` in any of places it may occur. It should be used to mark the item or person who has something in common.

> `私は京都に行きました。黒さんも京都に行きました。` I went to Kyoto. Kuro also went to Kyoto.

> `かばんを買いました。本も買いました。` I bought a bag. I also bought a book.
