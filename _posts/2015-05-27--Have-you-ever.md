You can indicate the past experience of doing something with the past tense short form of a verb, followed by `ことがある`.

This is a helper that describes exactly that effect.

> `ヨーロッパに行ったことがありますか` -> `Have you ever been to Europe?`

> `はい、行ったことがあります` -> `Yes, I have.`

The weird thing here is that the tense comes from the verb before `ことがある` and not from the helper.
