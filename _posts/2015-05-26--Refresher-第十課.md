Here we are, the final lesson that was completed before falling off the train. This lesson's big point is making comparisons, along with omitting nouns with `の`, intentions, becoming something, and extending the idea of `something` and `anything`.

##### Making Comparisons

In Japanese, making comparisons is done by adding words that function like particles to the nouns being compared.

> `[A] の方が [B] より [adj]`

When comparing items, `の方が` is a compound particle that indicates that the noun exemplifies the characteristic more than the other. `より` is a particle with a rough meaning of `than`.

Looking at the above pattern, let's put it into a proper sentence.

> `林より森の方が大きいです` > `The forest is bigger than the woods.`

Let's break it down!

> [Woods] (than) [Forest] (most) [Big].

You may be able to see that the particles modify the words before them with the ideas above. The `Forest` is the most, while the `Woods` are not. The most what? `Big`.

###### Asking Which

You can ask someone else for their opinion on things in comparative terms as such:

> `[A]と[B]とどっちの方が[Prop]`

Here, we create a list of the two nouns compared with the `と` particle, indicating an exhaustive list, and use the question word `どっち` to ask `which`, followed by the compound particle `の方が`.

This is in essence, saying `Of A and B, which is most Property?`

###### Three or More

When comparing three or more objects, the degree modifier `一番` is used.

> `[class of items]の中で[A]が一番[Property]ですか`

Literally, the `の中で` means `within`, indicating `within this type of item`. The second half should make sense.

When asking a question about this type of thing, you'd use a normal question word in place of [A].

##### Omitting Nouns

Admit it, at this point it sounds really stilted to say something like `I have a brown cat. I have a black cat too.` Naturally, in English, we would say `I have a brown cat. A black one too.`

The Japanese also do this, by using the particle `の` in place of subsequent references to a noun.

> `茶色の猫がいる。黒いのも。`

You can use it in other situations as well.

> `お茶を飲みに行った、でも、麦のがない。` - `I went to drink tea, but there wasn't any barley.`

You can also use this concept to omit further nouns in a string of nouns.

> `これ、ランドムのタオルですか` - `Is this Random's towel?`

>  `ううん、私のです` - `No, that's mine.`

##### Intentions

You can express your intention to do (or not do) something by using the suffix `つもり`.

> `[V present, short]つもりだ` - `I intend to do V`

> `今夜たくさん飲むつもりだよ` -> `Tonight I'm gonna drink a lot!`

You can negative this as well with a short form negative verb.

> `あぁ、飲まないつもりだ` - `Aah, I'm not drinking again.`

##### Becoming Something

To say you're becoming a trait or noun, use the following pattern...

> `[Adj]になる`

Please note, for an `い-adjective`, you would use the `く` shortening of the adjective instead, ie: `暖かくなる` (to become warmer).

These sentences are ambiguous in relativity. That is, with the above, it's unclear whether it's not no longer cold, or if it's just warmer than it was before. In order to make it more clear, you can use the above comparison pattern.

> `今は今朝より暖かくなりました` - `It's warmer now than this morning.`

##### Any/Some/Not

A couple of lessons ago, we learned the words for `something` and `not...anything` -- `何か`, and `何も`.

This paradigm extends into various other question words.

- `だれか_` - someone
- `だれ_も` - not anyone
- `どこか_` - anywhere
- `どこ_も` - not anywhere

These sorts of words can be used by themselves, in place of the particles `は`, `が`, or `を`. When used with the other particles, that particle becomes part of the construct in place of the blanks left above.

> `誰か`<u>`に`</u>`会いましたか` - Did you see anyone?

> `ううん,誰`<u>`に`</u>`も会いませんでした` - No, I didn't see anyone.

##### Means

One can use the particle `で` to describe the means by which an action is performed.

> `箸でご飯を食べました` - `I ate with chopsticks.`

> `家でテレビで映画を見ました` - `I watched a movie at home on TV`.

Starting tomorrow I get back on track with Lesson 11!
