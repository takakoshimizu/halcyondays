Moving right on along to Lesson 3, where we being to work with verbs. As with many Japanese learning resources, all that is taught to begin with is the present affirmative and negative forms, in formal speech. Other forms, conjugations, and casual speech come later.

##### Verb Conjugation

There are two categories of verbs, for purposes of explanation-- `ru` verbs and `u` verbs.

> Genki explains `ru` verbs as verbs that end in `ru` applied to the verb base, and `u` verbs as verbs with `u` applied to the base. This is silly, as the bases mean nothing and are just part of another conjugation.

In reality, `ru` verbs (or `ichidan verbs`) are a class of verbs that end in a `ru`, following either an `え` syllable or `い` syllable, or a some bare kanji. They are called `ichidan` because only one change is required to conjugate these verbs.

> Verb classes are difficult, full of exceptions, and honestly are just better as a "you'll learn over time" thing.

`u` verbs (or `godan verbs`) comprise of everything else. These are verbs that end in an `う` sound for every other consonant, and a few exceptions. They are called `godan` because five changes of the final sound are possible.

> Genki does horribly here, explaining conjugation in terms of romanization, and breaking syllables apart.

For purposes of simplification (heh) later on, we will refer to, as Genki does, the part of a verb before the `ます` as the 'stem'.

##### Present Tense

In Japanese, a "present tense" verb does not mean that a person is currently performing an action. They mean that that action is either habitual or that it will happen in the future. Confusing, I know.

##### More Particles

Japanese has many particles. Here are a few more.

###### で

One of the uses of the particle `で` is to indicate where the event described by the verb takes place.

> There are other uses for most of these particles, but only a few are described in this Lesson to prevent overload.

###### に

One of the uses of `に` is to indicate the goal of a movement verb. This differs from `で` in that `で` indicates only where an action takes place, but `に` indicates the final location of a verb's action.

Another usage is to indicate the time at which an action takes place. Some time words stand alone without the `に`. These are described below.

> Approximate time references can be made by substituting words such as `ごろ` and `ぐらい` in place of the `に`.

###### へ

Pronounced `え` as a particle, `へ` also indicates the goal of movement. The difference in nuance is similar to saying `I am going to the store (に)` and `I am heading to the store (but may do other things in the process) (へ)`.

###### を

Pronounced `お` when used as a particle, `を` performs the job of marking the direct object of a verb. A direct object is the thing that is directly affected by the action of the noun. For example:

> `I drink coffee.` - `コーヒーを飲[の]みます` - the direct object is `coffee` which is being drunk.

##### Time References

As mentioned above, you need the particle `に` when referencing days of the week as in `on sunday`, and numerical time expressions, such as `at 10:42` and `in September`.

> `日曜日[にちようび]に。。。`

> `十時四十二分[じゅうじよんじゅうにぶん]に。。。`

> `九月[きゅうがつ]に。。。`

The particle is NOT needed for relative time expressions, regular intervals, or the word 'when'.

##### ませんか

Using the present tense negative followed by a `か` extends an invitation.

> `昼ごはんを食べませんか` - Won't you have lunch with me?

##### Word Order

The only real requirement of a proper Japanese sentence is that it ends in a verb. Otherwise, the arrangement of other noun-particle sequences, adverbs, times, frequencies, etc, is largely freeform.

> For simplicity, however, sentences will often begin with a topic or subject, followed by time-place-object, ending with a verb.

##### Frequency Adverbs

You can use frequency adverbs such as `毎日[まいにち]`, `よく`, and `時々[ときどき]` to describe how often you do something.

When using *negative* adverbs such as `全然[ぜんぜん]` or `あまり`, they must be paired with a negative verb. They won't make much sense if used positively.

##### The Topic Particle

The topic sometimes is a subject, and other times just the topic. Particularly, with time expressions, it's like saying `let's talk about weekends...`

It can also be used to invite the completion of a sentence from a listener.
