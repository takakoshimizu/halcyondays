Finally! Not only are we back to where this blog was started, but we are back to casual language, or the so-called "short forms" lesson of Genki.

Short forms, dictionary forms, casual forms--they're the most used part of the language. While you may think that polite speech is used more, you'd be wrong, because even in polite speech, the casual forms are used for many constructs.

##### Casual Language

The following summarizes how casual language differs from polite language...

- Verbs & `い-adjectives`
  - Same as their dictionary forms
- `な-adjectives` and affirmative nouns
  - Replace `です` with `だ`
- `な-adjectives` nouns, and `い-adjectives` in the negative
  - `ない` instead of `ありません`

As always, `いい` is irregular and is negative: `よくない`.

###### Casual Negative Verbs

Verbs in the casual negative are more in depth.

For `る-verbs`, one simply removes the ending and adds `ない`.

> `食べる` -> `食べない`

For `う-verbs`, one converts the final sound to a `あ` sound and adds `ない`

> `あそび` -> `遊ばない`

> Note: Verbs ending in `う` become `わない` instead.

Irregular verbs `する` and `くる` become `しない` and `こない` respectively.

Furthermore, `ある` simply becomes `ない`.

##### Uses of Short Forms

Short forms are used all over the place. We will start with a few uses.

- Represented speech.
- In casual conversations as signs of intimacy
- Making negative requests.
- In expressing verbs as nouns. ie: `to run` -> `running`

###### Quotations

The casual form is used at the end of a quotation or thought, followed by `と` used as a quotation particle, then the verb, such as `言っていました`. Note that it for `someone said` you will use the past tense `て-form`, because it was an period of action. For a thought, it'd be simply present tense.

###### Casual Conversation

In Japanese, speaking casually with someone can imply intimacy, seniority, or lack of respect. To speak in long forms with someone, it's similar to referring to a person as `Mr.` or `Mrs.` in English, while short forms is like a first name basis.

Keeping respectful is a huge part of the society, so be mindful of this. The Japanese are very big on seniority as well, so it's normal for a senior to speak to a junior in casual form, but expect polite form in return.

In casual conversation, the question particle `か` is usually dropped, with a rising intonation instead as in English. Additionally, the sentence coppola `だ` is generally dropped.

On top of this, `はい` and `いいえ` are replaced with a more simple `うん` and `ううん` respectively.

###### Please don't...

The casual form can be used to make a negative request, similar to how the `て-form` can be combined with `ください` to make a positive request.

To make a negative request, tack `でください` to a negative short form.

> `そこで座らないでください` -> `please don't sit there`

###### Nominalization

One can convert a verb into a noun expressing the idea of that verb by appending `の` to the dictionary form.

> `掃除する` -> `to clean` -> `掃除するの` -> `cleaning`

> `歩く` -> `to walk` -> `歩くの` -> `walking`

To be good or bad at doing something involves using the nominalized verb as a subject, and applying `上手` or `下手` to it.

> `日本語を話すの下手です` -> `I am bad at speaking Japanese`

One can use the same structure with `好き` and `嫌い` to indicate liking to do something, or disliking it.

##### が

The particle `が` is a difficult one. To simplify it a lot, it's used to fill or create a blank where information should be put in.

For example, `who went to Okinawa`? `ロバートさんが`. Consider it like a stress on the word previous. ROBERT did.

Similarly it is used with question words to create the same blank to fill.

 - WHICH shop is best? `どっちの店が...`
 - WHO has long hair? `だれが...`

Unfortunately, it's one of those things you have to get a feel for. I don't have it down. Some Japanese people don't quite either. It's a tough one.

##### Something and anything.

The word for `something` in a positive sentence is `何か` and the word for `anything` in a negative sentence is `何も`

 - Positive statements: 何か something
 - Questions: 何か anything?
 - Negative statements: 何も not anything / nothing.
