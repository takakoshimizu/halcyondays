So far, we've only learned how to factually report on events. Now, we are going to learn how to explain what happened.

A simple report is simply an unadulterated fact. A proper explanation may have a nuance of hinting at something, or being apologetic.

An explanation has two components: what's explicitly stated in the sentence, and an implication of what that sentence is covering.

> `明日テストがあいます。` -> I have a test tomorrow.

This is simply an observation that there's a test.

> `明日テストがあるんです。` -> I have a test tomorrow...

This has an implication that you're trying to say that since you have a test tomorrow, you can't perform some other function. You may be saying you can't go out tonight.

As you can see above, `んです` comes after the short form of the predicate. This can be in any tense or alignment, and sets the actual tense of the sentence. `んです` is simply a sentence ender!

When it follows a noun or `な-adjective`, the `な` will be present.

> `どうして静かなんですか？` -> Why are you quiet?

You can also use it to ask questions in which you want an explanation in return.

Lastly, it can be used to provide an extra comment on what's just been said.
