I have been struggling lately with getting back on track, and I'm finding myself very disappointed in myself. You see, when I first started this process, I was studying for 1+ hour every day, be it Genki, or Wanikani (mostly WK), and rarely if ever missing a day.

Now I'm at the point where I haven't studied at all in about 4 months. It's so far outside my daily routine that I don't even know how to make it part of it again. It seems like it'll have to be a major feat of will...and will is something I don't have much of these days.

I'm also so very distracted with software development things.

But I'm going to have to try. I'm too far in now to stop now. I can learn Japanese. I just have to make myself do it.
