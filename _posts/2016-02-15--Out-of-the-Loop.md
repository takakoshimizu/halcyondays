At this point, I haven't studied Japanese properly in several months.

I fell out of studying from Genki somewhere around September. I just felt I didn't have time.

I stopped studying Wanikani in mid-November.

I took the JLPT N4 that December. I passed by a single point, without having completed Genki II. I do, however, think this was just a fluke, and more a result of test-taking prowess than actual Japanese ability.

After the JLPT, I began listening to JapanesePod101, as my weak point was definitely listening.

I listened heavily for about a month, to two or three lessons a day. I then, once my trial ran out, purchased a year.

For some reason as soon as I did that, I stopped listening to Jpod101 too.

I am in a serious slump that I don't know how to get out of. I can *feel* my memory atrophying. I can feel the strain when I see something I *should* know. Yet, I don't. Or don't easily.

I need to get out of it and I don't know how.
