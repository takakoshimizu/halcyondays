At this point, I've been more or less inactive in grammar studies since deciding to try to buy a house.

Well, that's over now, and I now want to get back on track.

My current plans are to finish level 25 in Wanikani and go on Vacation Mode to prevent it from burning me out.

While that's going on, I will not return to Wanikani until I have completed both volumes of Genki. For reference, that is 14 lessons. I am currently on lesson 11 of Genki I.

However, I will need to spend the next week while finishing Wanikani reviewing previous lessons to refresh my memory. I be re-reading the grammar sections and doing spot exercises in the workbook and textbook to shore up the knowledge.

Additionally, I guess I should re-read through some Textfugu and Tae Kim.

Seriously, I'm tired of being bested by people who haven't even studied. I'm tired of being presented with Japanese text and not knowing where to even begin.

It's time to get my shit back together.
