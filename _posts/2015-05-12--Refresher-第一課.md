A new series will begin temporarily, in which I will go over each lesson up through 10, and summarize the grammar points available in my own words.

The purpose of this is to refresh my knowledge of older ideas before blazing forward again. Let's start with Lesson 1.

(side note: oh god there's romaji again)

##### XはYです。

One of the most simple and common grammar points in Japanese is the pattern `XはYです.` This pattern describes the general idea of `X is Y` in English terms. Technically, it's a bit more complicated in that, in that the `は` particle is marking the `X` as the topic of the sentence. Note that the topic is different from a subject.

> `は` is pronounced `wa`, in romanization, when used as a particle.

> There are no quantity indications, such as "a" or "the" in Japanese.

##### Questions

Another important particle is the `か`, a particle which, when used at the end of a sentence, makes that sentence a question. Additionally, the grammar part goes over the usage of `なん` and　`なに`, specifically that `なん` tends to be used a sentence final or a counter, while `なに` would be used more with a particle.

##### の

Finally, Lesson 1 finishes out with the `の` particle. This particle has many uses, but in Lesson 1 only the connective use. It can be used like `'s` in English, as well as the same concept as `of` or `in.` Essentially, connected by this particle, one noun modifies another.

> In Japanese, the main idea comes last, and any modification comes before it.

##### Expression Notes

There are a handful of useful expressions noted at the end of Lesson 1's grammar.

 - `あの` - Pretty much `ummm...` in English, where you have something to say but have reservations about it.
 - `はい`, `ええ` and `うん` - All mean yes. Varying levels of politeness on the way down. See also: `いいえ` and `ううん.`
 - `そうですか` - Aizuchi, wherein you talk simply to show you're still paying attention. Means `Is that so?` or `I see.`
