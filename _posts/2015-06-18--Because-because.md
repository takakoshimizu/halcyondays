There are multiple ways to explain reasons for an event. We've seen two so far: `から` and `ので`.

Both of these allow you to give only *one* reason. We will now learn a particle that allows you to give multiple...or only one, but leave the implication that there are more.

The particle `し` can be used in the same way as `から` with the same grammatical rules. That is, the state of being must include `だ` and each reason must include a `し`.

The idea behind this is similar to the difference between `と` and `や`, in that `から` and `ので` imply that there is only that reason, and `し` allows for more.
