You can add `そうです` to adjectives to say that something seems or looks like it has that quality.  When it's used, we are saying it based purely on our perceptions.

> `このリンゴは美味しそうです` This apple looks delicious.

As you can see, `そうです` is used wih `い-adjectives` by removing the final `い` and adding `そうです`.

With `な-adjectives` you simply leave off the `な` and append `そうです`.

You can use it with negative adjectives as well. In this case, the `ない` is changed to `なさ`.

> `この本は難しくなさそうです` This book doesn't seem difficult.

You can qualify a noun with this structure.

An important note is that this is all based on perception and not actual experience. If you eat an apple, you can no longer say it looks delicious, because you now know it is or isn't. Likewise, if something is purely visual, you can't say it "looks pretty" because you know it is or isn't.
