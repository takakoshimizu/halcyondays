Moving on to lesson 7, we will learn more uses of the `て-form`, among other things. Remember as stated with yesterday's post, the `て-form` is probably the most important construct for one to know.

##### ていろ

The `ている` form is an important extension of the `て-form` that indicates one of three things...

1. That a verb is in a continuous state.
2. That a verb indicates an ongoing activity.
3. That a verb indicates a change that is still important.

The `ていろ` form is created by conjugating a `て-form` and attaching the helping verb `いる`, which may be further conjugated itself. If you remember yesterday's post, at one point I had an example about watching TV and then going to bed. I used the `ている` form further conjugated to a *second* `て-form` to indicate both an ongoing action and a continuation.

> `見ていて`

These three things depend on the type of the verb. Some describe  state, such as `いる`, and `ある`, though these never will be used in a `ている`. Some describe activities, and others describe the change.

You can also use `ている` to describe what a person does by occupation. So the same phrase would have two interpretations: that you're currently doing that verb, or that you do that verb for a living.

> `日本語を教えている` -> `I teach Japanese` -> `I am teaching Japanese (right now)`

Something special to note is that the verbs `行く` and `来る` are in the third category: instant changes that may still be significant. Thus, they indicate current states that resulted from prior movement and not that they are currently moving.

##### Attributes

To describe a person's attributes, you could indeed say `ランドムさんの髪は長いです`, but it sounds stilted. A more natural way to say it would be `ランドムさんは髪が長いです`, setting the topic on Random, and the subject as his hair. This applies to physical attributes in general, such as height.

##### Combining Sentences Pt. 2

In the last post, we learned that the `て-form` can be used to combine two verb sentences into a longer continuous sentence. As it turns out, adjectives and nouns have `て-forms` as well, and can do the same thing.

The `て-form` of an `い-adjective` is made by removing the `い` and subbing in `くて`. The `て-form` of a noun or `な-adjective` is formed by adding a `で`.

##### Purposes

One can use a construct consisting of a verb stem + `に` + a movement verb to show the purpose of the movement.

> `テレビを借りに来る` -> I've come to borrow the TV
