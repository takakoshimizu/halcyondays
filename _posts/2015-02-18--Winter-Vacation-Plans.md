Just as a note, the dialog for 第十課　has been read. A summary follows…

Winter vacation is approaching. Mary comments on the fact that it’s getting cold, and Takeshi asks her what she’s doing for the winter break. Mary intends to go to either South Korea, or Taiwan, but isn’t sure which yet.

Takeshi is distracted, probably by some other girl, and answers “that’s nice…” like he wasn’t paying attention anyway.

Mary again repeats South Korea and Taiwan, and asks Takeshi which he thinks is better. Takeshi, now finally free of some other ho, answers that Taiwan is warmer, but Sue said Korean food is awesome. Mary is still noncommittal, but asks Takeshi if he’s going anywhere. Hint: come with me. Takeshi says he has no money so will stay home. Mary says she’ll kill him. Takeshi is a plank.


## LATER

At a travel agency, Mary asks the travel agent to get a ticket to Seoul. She neglects to mention when, so the agent asks her. She’s leaving on December 19th. The agent states there’s an AM and PM flight. Mary elects for the morning, and uses a credit card. She then asks about how long the flight is. It’s about an hour.
