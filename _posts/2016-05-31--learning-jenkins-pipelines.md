I'm learning Jenkins Pipelines right now because Blue Ocean looks like it'll be awesome.

Previously, everything was orchestrated via Freestyle projects. This is probably a much better way of handling everything.

Will see how it goes!

(As a side: I'm still failing at starting Japanese again. I blame Overwatch.)
