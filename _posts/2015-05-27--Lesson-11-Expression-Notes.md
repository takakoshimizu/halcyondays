For whatever reason, in Lesson 11, there are just as many expression notes as there are full fledged grammar points. These are all major grammar as well, so they need to be cataloged.

###### は in negative sentences

You'll often find the particle `は` in negative sentences where you'd expect a `を` or `が`. While neither of those are incorrect either, most speakers just find it natural.

Apparently the rule of thumb is that negative Japanese sentences contain at least one `は` phrase.

The particle may also follow other particles like `で` and `に`.

###### だけ

You can add `だけ` to numbers to talk about having just that many items. It implies you have what's needed, but not any more.

###### に

`に` can also be used to indicate the occasion on which you do something.

> `晩ご飯にサラダを食べました` -> `I ate Salad _at_ dinner`

`に` can also indicate the role you want something to play.

> `お土産に葉書を買いました` -> `I bought a postcard _as_ a souvenir.`

###### ドライブ

A `ドライブする` is driving for pleasure. When driving for a purpose, use `運転する`.

###### Dreams

Just like English, dream can be both what you see in your sleep, or a desire.

The word for both is `夢`, but expressing it is different for each type. You would use `見る` for a sleeping dream, (`to see a dream`), but use `持っている` or `ある` for a future desire (`to have a dream`).

###### には

The particle `は` often follows `に` when describing a place in terms of things found there. It adds an implication that the sentences are about the places, while without the `は`, it's more of an answer to a vague question.
