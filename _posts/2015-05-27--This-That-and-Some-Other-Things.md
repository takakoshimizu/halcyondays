We already know about connecting two clauses with the `て-form`, but that, much like the particle `と`, is indicative of an exhaustive list of actions. There is a slight variation on the verb ending when used as an example of things done: `たり`.

The `たり` ending of a verb can be constructed by adding `り` to the past tense short form of a verb.

> `食べたり` -> `to eat`

> `遊んだり` -> `to play`

You can string together as many examples as you want, but at the end, you must use the helping verb `する` to apply a tense to your entire sentence.

> `ランドムさんの家で食べたり、遊んだりした。` -> `At Random's house, I did things like eat and play.`
