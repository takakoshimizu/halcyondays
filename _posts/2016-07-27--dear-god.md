My god, it's been too long.

I've actually gotten back into full swing with Wanikani again, but as usual, that's only my vocabulary, and doesn't actually help me understand the language all that much.

I asked the staff to reset my level from 32 to 25, because all of the more recent stuff was not at all fresh in my memory. I picked back up, and am now almost level 27 again. So this is at least SOME progress.

Otherwise, I have not worked in Genki again. I haven't even finished my refresher. I need to get on that ASAP. Same with listening via JapanesePod101. I paid for that sub, and haven't even touched it in like 3-4 months.

It's pathetic. I have to be better than this.

Still blaming Overwatch.
