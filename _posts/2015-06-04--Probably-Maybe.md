You can use the sentence-final `でしょう` to express that we are making a guess or prediction. A rough translation would be `probably`.

`でしょう` follows the short forms in affirmative or negative present. It can also follow past tense, but that'll come later.

> `明日、ランドムさんはフィギュアを買うでしょう。` Random will probably buy a figure tomorrow.

> `東京は寒くないでしょう` It's probably not cold in Tokyo.

It can also follow nouns and `な-adjectives`. In these cases, it goes directly after them, with no `な` or `だ`.

`でしょうか` can be used to invite another person's opinion or guess.

The short form is `だろう`. It could also be used within a quotation to express a prediction or analysis.

In casual exchanges, you can use `でしょう` with a rising intonation, as well as `でしょ` to check if your partner agrees with you, or that you understand correctly.
