Continuing on after the short weekend, we arrive at the fifth lesson of the Genki textbooks. The major point to this lesson is the use of adjectives.

##### Adjectives

There are two kinds of adjectives in Japanese-- `い-adjectives` and `な-adjectives`. They are so named for the last character used in them before they modify a noun.

Each type conjugates and is used differently.

###### い-adjectives

`い-adjectives` conjugate similarly to casual form verbs (which are still 3 lessons out). In essence, the `い` ending is exchanged for the endings seen below. Please note that past negative is a combination of both the past and negative endings.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Affirmative</th>
    <th>Negative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Present</td>
    <td>面白い</td>
    <td>面白くない</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Past</td>
    <td>面白かった</td>
    <td>面白くなかった</td>
  </td>
</table>

An exception to this rule is the adjective `いい`. This is because `いい` is actually `良い[よい]` and as a result, all other forms than the present affirmative begin with `よ`.

###### な-adjectives

`な-adjectives` are much more straightforward, and conjugate exactly as nouns do.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Affirmative</th>
    <th>Negative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Present</td>
    <td>元気です</td>
    <td>元気じゃありません</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Past</td>
    <td>元気でした</td>
    <td>元気じゃありませんでした</td>
  </td>
</table>

##### Love and Hate

Two important adjectives are `好き` and `嫌い`, meaning `liked` and `disliked`. While difficult at first, in Japanese one does not say they like something--instead it is said that the object is liked.

> `日本語が好きです。` - I like Japanese / Japanese is liked (by me).

##### Degree Adverbs

There are many words for modifying the degree to which an adjective is applied. For example, `とても` means `very` and `ちょっと` means `a little`.

> `ちょっと厚いです` - It's a little hot.

> `とても面白いです` - It's very interesting.

Please note that `好き` and `嫌い` have their own intensity modifiers, by prefixing them with `大` to intensify the feeling.

##### Suggestions

You can suggest a plan of action by using the verb ending `ましょう` in place of the formal `ます` ending.

> `映画を見ましょう！` - Let's see a movie.

> `スーパーでPS4を買いましょうか?` - Why don't we go buy a PS4 at the supermarket?

##### Counting

In Japanese, one counts with a special counter word for the type of object being counted. For now, let's just remember that `枚[まい]` is used for counting flat objects, such as sheets of paper, stamps, and stickers.

> `三枚の切符をください` - Three tickets, please.

Coming up tomorrow in the refresher for Lesson 6, the `て-form`, a very important verb form used for roughly half the language.
