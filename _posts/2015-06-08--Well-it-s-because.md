Here, we are gonna be given a cue to use as a reason, and will come up with the `because` clause on our own. The connecting particle will be `ので`.

- `お金がないので、食べませんでした。`
 - I don't have any money, so I didn't eat.
- `おなかがすいているので、ハンバーガーを買います。`
 - I'm gonna buy a hamburger because I'm hungry.
- `ホームシックなので、日本に帰ります。`
 - I'm going back to Japan because I'm homesick.
- `用事があるので、統合が悪いです。`
 - I have something to do, so that's a little inconvenient for me.
- `単語の意味が分からないので、説いてください。`
 - I don't understand the meaning of the word, so please explain it.
- `疲れたので、早く寝ます。`
 - I'm tired, so I'm going to bed early.

The rest is all class related stuff, or exercises on easy things (`でしょう`) so I guess I'm done with Lesson 12!

Moving on to the reading section, and once's that's done, wow, Genki I is done. Sadly I still don't feel like I know much.
