A statement in the form 'noun A `なら` predicate X' shows that the predicate X applies only to the noun A, and is not more generally valid. The main ideas are comparison and contrast.

The particle is also used as a conditional but I imagine that'll go into more depth later. Honestly, I don't really understand this explanation of `なら` at all.
